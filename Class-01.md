## The bitter after taste of progress

*"He peruses the menu" 
"I'll have the twitter website please" the waiter (TCP/IP) rolls his eyes  
"That order comes with either existential threat or cats?" he says  
"I'll take the cats"  
"and what pronouns would you like with that?"  
The order is assigned a number and sent to the kitchen where the "chef" (DNS) sneers at the choices made and barks orders at the kitchen staff  
piece by piece the ingredients are found and assembled by HTML, CSS Deals with the presentation,   
"SERVICE" (200 OK) Screams the chef.   
the waiter delivers the order.  
condiments are chosen, temperatures are tested (JS) and content is consumed.*  


*Describe how HTML, CSS, and JS files are “parsed” in the browser.*

HTML is parsed first so the browser can find any links or script tags calling external style sheets and Javascript files from the server. 
Browser generates...

  - In Memory CSSOM tree is generated 

Compiles and executes parsed javascript. A visaul representatio of he site is displayed on the screen.

# Introduction to HTML


*What is an HTML attribute?*

An attribute contains extra information that will not appear in the content but will effect it in some way.  
e.g. a class attribute can be used to apply styling to an element. 

An attribute should have:

- A space between it and the element name. (For an element with more than one attribute, the attributes should be separated by spaces too.)
- The attribute name, followed by an equal sign.
- An attribute value, wrapped with opening and closing quote marks.
