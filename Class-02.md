#Learn CSS

**What are ways we can apply CSS to our HTML?**

CSS can be applies in 3 ways;

  *inline* - means to add the css to the element with the html being effected. This is only really used for small examples and should be avoided.
  
  An *Internal* style sheet is applieed inside a style tag in the head of the html document as seen below. Can be useful for adding to css while using 
  CMS and are blocked from modifying the external css files. 
  
  ```
   <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <title>My CSS experiment</title>
    <style>
      h1 {
        color: blue;
        background-color: yellow;
        border: 1px solid black;
      }

      p {
        color: red;
      }
    </style>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Hello World!</h1>
  ```
  
  An *External* style sheet is the best practice approach to applying CSS. this keeps the CSS all together in a file seperate to the html making it easier to read and edit. 
  ```
   <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <title>My CSS experiment</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Hello World!</h1>
  ```
